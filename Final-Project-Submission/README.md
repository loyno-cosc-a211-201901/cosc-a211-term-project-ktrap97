The final project includes both the project presentation and the submitted programming work.

## This Pull Request is **REQUIRED**

In this milestone, you will submit all of the files related to your work, including not just the program files, but also files from your presentation.

## Your files must compile without errors

Compile errors will not be tolerated; they will cause a major penalty on your score.

I will try to compile on MacOS and on Windows.  I don't really want you to have code specific to Windows or to MacOS, but it will not be grounds for a penalty. You will only be penalized if your program doesn't compile on *either*.

## Your files must execute without errors

If the user enters correct input, your program should never cause an error.

If you have difficulties making input "robust," or "resilient," please put notes in the code or in a separate text file.  Ideally, when you prompt the user for input, you should tell the user about anything tricky in your prompt message, e.g.,

	cout << "Please enter how many times to run the process" << endl;
	cout << "Note that this number must be a multiple of seven, or else the results will" << endl;
	cout << "be unpredicatable" << endl;
	
## Written Term Project Papers

You may submit your term projects in these formats: 

* Microsoft Word (`.docx`, `.doc`)
* OpenOffice/LibreOffice documents (`.odt`)
* Portable Document Format (`.pdf`)

Other word-processing formats will not be accepted.

You do not need to use GitHub for a written paper term project.

## Test A Lot!!

The more you test, the more you will find errors and, perhaps as valuable, ways to improve your program.

## Commit, Push, Create Pull Request to "Z-finished-final-project"
...just as you have done throughout the semester.

## Programming Projects Will Be Graded Through GitHub

As with all of your regular homework assignments, submission through GitHub is required.
